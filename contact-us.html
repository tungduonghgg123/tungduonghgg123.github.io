    <h1>FAQ (frequently asked questions)</h1>
    <strong>How to fill in the score automatically?</strong>
    <p>
      For example, the game consists of 4 players. You just need to key in the 3
      player's scores in any other. The last player's score will be calculated
      automatically.<br />
      In case you are modifying the score after this process. You can simply
      remove the player's score that you wish to be automatically filled; then
      press enter or just click outside of the field.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>How to change the player's name?</strong>
    <p>
      Simply click on the player's name, you should be redirected to the
      player's details screen where you can change the player's name.

      >I have deleted the player, why does this player still appear in the
      previous matches?</strong
    >
    <p>
      The core idea of Zero Sum Score is that the total score for each match is
      equal to 0. So to preserve this logic and to keep the previous matches
      consistent, the player's score will still be displayed in the previous
      matches even though the player has been deleted.
